This is my 2025 Semester 1 Multivariable Calculus project. I coded a simple two-mirror telescope simulation that models the cross-section of the two mirrors for simplicity 
and I also included a top-down view of the objective mirror to represent aberrations/focus. The main idea of the project is to optimize a two-mirror design with a fixed 
distance and orientation, changing curvature and eccentricity to combat spherical aberrations and coma. A gradient descent function is also present to help 
facilitate the optimization process.

To run the code, you need to install python

In your terminal, type: pip install numpy plotly dash

To start the sim, type: python telescope_three.py
